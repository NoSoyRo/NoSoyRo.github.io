        Throughout this personal website I will expose you several of my personal projects, hence 
        you will have access to all mi repositories available of each relevant project.
        
        I am a Mexican born the 28th of May of 1998, and since I was child I've been 
        charmed by creative processes such as building legos, thats why now I am very passionate
        about creating with science.

        Student and graduate of the Faculty of Sciences of the UNAM, in Physics and pure 
        Mathematics, passionate about the study and not obliged to it. Creator of the 
        Animathica project. Faithful believer that goals are achieved 99% due to discipline, 
        passion, creativity, healthy habits and dedication; while 1% is due to genius. 
        Self-taught young man who is responsible and in constant competition with himself, 
        as well as an athlete from an early age.

                Rodrigo is a person with a hunger to eat up the world, that is, 
                he has big goals and therefore, he has big plans to reach them. On the other hand, 
                he has lived through very complicated situations but instead of seeing them as 
                impossible obstacles to overcome, he takes them as inspiration to overcome them, that 
                is, until now nothing has been able to bring him down. Disciplined person, full of 
                habits, with values, and principles with which he seeks to improve himself on a daily 
                basis.

        This is a relevant subset of the complete set made of all the projects I have ever developed.
        This subset of personal projects are projects that are related to the fields of Physics, 
        Mathematics and Computer Science in which I am the most interested.
